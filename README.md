# Light

Please read the following pages in the iBook: 50 - 57 and 71 - 95.  Pages 71 - 95 are the introduction to the interface builder
so that you can get started creating programs for your iPhone!  You don't have to commit this material to memory, but a strong
foundation will be very helpful when completing your next project.

The Light project is a GUIDED project, if you follow the directions step by step, you should have no problems finishing.
It starts on page 95 and goes all the way to page 112.  It includes some very important information, including how to hook 
up the controls you see on your phone to code that you write. 

I think that you will find this simple project very important on your way to becoming iPhone programmers.

This is a completion grade worth 10 points.  When you open this project you will see that I have gotten you started.
